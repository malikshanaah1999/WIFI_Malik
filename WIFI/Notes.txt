First of all, We have our TX block that contains the following sub-blocks which we'll design 
later on:

Scrambler -> Encoder -> Interleaver -> Mapper -> IFFT -> GI Adder.

The output of these blocks we be added to the preamble and it's worth mentioning that the order 
of sending them is crucial, so we need to transmit the preamble, signal, and the data. in order.

After that, -> OFDM-based Modulation.
